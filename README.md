# Chicago Crime Analyzer

## Introduction

The Chicago Crime Analyzer project aims to analyze crime trends and patterns in Chicago using data from the Chicago Police Department. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project provides insights into crime hotspots, temporal patterns, and types of crimes prevalent in different neighborhoods.
We have a dataset which contains the crime record of Chicago city from 2004 to present. The dataset is in structured format which contains attributes of criminal such as Case number, Date of Crime, Location of Crime, Description of crime and Type of Crime etc. From this we analyse and come out with an output which can be used by police department, intelligence bureau, road and transport highway, detective agencies etc. We also predict the crime so that crime can be stopped before it is committed or at least collateral damage can be stopped. By this we will try to predict the criminal and place the crime may be committed.
Here's a sample README file for a Chicago crime analyzer project on GitHub. This README covers essential aspects of the project, including an introduction, data description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.


## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, analysis scripts, and visualization.
- `results/`: Directory for storing generated plots, reports, and analysis results.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies needed to run the project.

## Data

The dataset contains crime records from the Chicago Police Department, including:

- Crime type (e.g., theft, assault, robbery)
- Date and time of occurrence
- Location details (latitude, longitude, address, neighborhood)
- Arrest status
- Domestic-related incidents
- Ward, community area, and police district information
